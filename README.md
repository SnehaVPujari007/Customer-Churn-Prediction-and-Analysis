# Customer Churn Prediction and Analysis

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This project aims to predict customer churn and provide actionable insights to reduce it. Churn prediction is essential for businesses as acquiring new customers can be more costly than retaining existing ones. Using machine learning models, we analyze customer behavior patterns to identify factors that contribute to churn and predict which customers are likely to leave. This project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. </p>

<h3>Project Goals </h3>
<p>Predict customer churn with a high degree of accuracy.
Identify key factors that influence churn to help business stakeholders understand customer behavior.
Suggest actionable recommendations to reduce churn based on the insights gathered from data analysis. </p>
<h3>Data Source </h3>
<p>The dataset used in this project contains anonymized customer information, including demographics, account information, and service usage details. You can use the publicly available Telco Customer Churn dataset on Kaggle.
</p>

<h3>Technologies Used </h3>
<ol type = "1">
<li>Programming Languages: Python </li>
<li>Libraries:
Data Analysis: pandas, NumPy </li>
<li>Data Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn </li>
<li>Machine Learning: scikit-learn </li>
<li>Notebook Environment: Jupyter Notebook  </li>
<li>Version Control: Git </li>

</ol>

<h3>Data Preprocessing </h3>
<li>Missing Values: Impute or drop missing values as appropriate. </li>
<li>Feature Engineering: Create new features like "tenure group" or one-hot encode categorical features. </li>
<li>Scaling: Standardize or normalize numerical features to improve model performance. </li>
<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) </h3>
<li>Visualize the distribution of target variable (churn) and the relationships between features and churn. </li>
<li>Identify key factors influencing churn, such as tenure, contract type, and monthly charges. </li>
<li>Correlation analysis to understand the relationship between features. </li>
<h3>Modeling and Evaluation </h3>
<li>Model Selection: Use algorithms like logistic regression and decision trees to predict churn.</li>

<li>Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Results </li>

<li>Key Factors Influencing Churn: Contract type, monthly charges, and tenure were the top predictors of churn.</li>
<li>Recommendations: Offering discounts or incentives for customers with month-to-month contracts may reduce churn.
